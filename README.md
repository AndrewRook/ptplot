## Development roadmap
* Interface
  * Look at python ggplot2 implementation for inspiration
  * Use layered grammar of graphics
* Data
  * Store data in plot object for usage by other functions
     * Store multiple datasets? 
     * Store as dataframe versus bokeh datatype?
     * Store additional info, like index markers for frames or special columns?
* Field generation
  * Figure out how to allow for different sports fields
  * Figure out where to store information about field sizes in data units (also aspect ratios)
  * Figure out how to add to base figure
* Team information
  * Figure out how to allow for different leagues
  * Allow user to override
  * How to store team info for use in plotting
  * Also: the ball
     * custom glyphs?
* Static plots
  * Plot of positions at a certain frame/timestamp
  * Plot of tracks up to a certain frame/timestamp (default: all)
  * Legend by team, clickable to highlight one team or the ball
  * Support for having overlaid plots
  * Support for additional plot types
  * Support for hoverlabels (including handling case with multiple plots)
  * Support for faceting?
  * Support for splitting color/size/etc by column or expression (maybe depends on the plot?)
* Animations
  * Automatically convert static plot to animation by specifying frame/timestamp column
  * Sort data by frame/timestamp column, set indices for faster plot rendering as needed  

#### How to filter animations:
1. Add an animation trigger that sets the column containing the frame numbers and/or timestamps.
2. Set a Bokeh Filter on the plots for the default frame/timestamp.
3. Set up [animation stuff](https://discourse.bokeh.org/t/possible-to-use-customjs-callback-from-a-button-to-animate-a-slider/3985/3)
4. Store index information keyed by frame number, store also current frame number somehow.
5. For incremental plots, when moving forward in frames simply append the new frames
   onto the existing filter. When moving backward figure out how many indices to remove
   and then reset the filter length. 
6. For non-incremental plots, just reset the whole filter. 

# ptplot
`ptplot` makes it easy to turn player-tracking data into beautiful,
interactive visualizations â€” including animations! These visualizations can be used to guide
data exploration/analysis work, or to embed in webpages to share with
the world.

## Installation

`ptplot` can be installed via pip:

```bash
$ pip install ptplot
```

It is strongly recommended that you install `ptplot` into a virtual
environment, such as with [`conda`](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/):

```bash
[After installing conda]
$ conda create -n player_tracking python=3
$ conda activate player_tracking
$ pip install ptplot
```

You may wish to install some of `ptplot`'s dependencies
via conda, specifically `pandas` and `plotly`:

```bash
[After installing conda]
$ conda create -n player_tracking python=3 pandas plotly
$ conda activate player_tracking
$ pip install ptplot
```

## Getting Started

Making your first plot can be as simple as

```python
import pandas as pd
from ptplot import plotting
data = pd.read_csv([YOUR PLAYER TRACKING DATA])
fig = plotting.animate_positions(
    data, "x", "y", "frame"
)
fig.show()
```

For additional documentation and examples, check out the
notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory, which can be viewed
online with all of the plots correctly rendered via nbviewer:
1. [Basic Plots](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/AndrewRook/ptplot/blob/main/notebooks/1-Basic_Plots.ipynb)
2. [Animations](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/AndrewRook/ptplot/blob/main/notebooks/2-Animations.ipynb)
3. [Tips and Tricks](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/AndrewRook/ptplot/blob/main/notebooks/3-Tips_and_Tricks.ipynb)

Additionally, functions within `ptplot` have docstrings with
more usage details. Those can be accessed either by reading the
source code or running `help([FUNCTION])` inside of Python.
